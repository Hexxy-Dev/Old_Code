version naming:
C.B.S.T

C = any api change in the user facing implementation or cli
// Obviously some apps will no longer work after this
// auto incremented by compiler?????


B = any bugfix
// some apps might rely on unintended behaviour
// really hard to track or make developers be able to identify

S = security patches
// again really hard to identify :/

T = any other tweaks



with any new package release, all apps should be recompiled if possible (open source)
all apps that no longer work will have to recursively provide old packages until fixed
