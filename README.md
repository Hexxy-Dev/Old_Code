# OLD CODE
Just a simple repo with my old code.

The initial commit of a file will always be the original version, exactly as I had written it at that time... or at least what remained of it  
The current version is modified to compile on linux and maybe cleaned up a little.

I do not recommend trying to learn from this code

All projects have a readme containing all relevant information for that project

Commits starting with `OLD` are files that have been "manually versioned". ex: multiple copies of the same file with different dates. The order of these commits is possible to be wrong and many of them are missing lots of files.
