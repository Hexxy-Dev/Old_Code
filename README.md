# OLD CODE

### This is the place where one-off projects and non versioned code will collect over time.

---

Most projects have a readme containing all relevant information for that project

Commits naming scheme:
prefix | description
:-:|:-:
Old | "manually versioned" [^MVCS]
Original | the last version of that project
Random | files not part of any overarching theme

[^MVCS]: multiple copies of the same file with different dates. The order of these commits is possible to be wrong and many of them are missing lots of files.

These commits will always be the original version, exactly as I had written it at that time... or at least what remained of it  

# Beware of the undead

Just like any fantasy graveyard, some projects *might* get resurrected and pop up somewhere else >:3
