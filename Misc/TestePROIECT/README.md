UBB exam prep

Usage:
* in `ListaTeste.txt` add a new entry with the test you are going to attempt ex:`2021 iulie filename_without_extension`
* add a new .txt file with the name and path accodring to the above entry
* on each line, put the answers for that problem ex: *line 1:*`AC`
* after the time is up, or you completed the test, run the program
* depending on the `DebugLevel` from `ListaTeste.txt` it will tell you if you would have passed that exam and where you would have been placed, show you an overview of your mistakes, show you a statistic of where you made the same mistake on the same test multiple times and show you each mistake individually with the correct answer

### Not tested but it should run just fine
