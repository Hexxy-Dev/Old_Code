# NOT TESTED OR MODIFIED TO WORK ON LINUX

This was an interesting school project whose initial goal was to be able to read simple chemical formulas and compute their mass.

I wanted to do something more impressive at that time so I added locales and intended to make it parse "complex" formulas with () and even be able to write their full name but due to other work this has been left abandoned after completing the initial task.

### This was an interesting idea and I tink I might try to actually do it better at some point
###### maybe even add 3D visualisation of atoms and stuff?
