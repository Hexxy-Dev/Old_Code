Rubik's cube scramble visualizer

Supports most[^1] standard notations

[^1]: aside from whole cube rotations  
although these functions are already implemented, they are not exposed to the user

The implementation used here is quite good. Could be better (less code duplication) but overall is quite well made I'd say.

The scramble is read from `Input.in`

inverse notation can be any of `'` `i` `p`

moves: `R` `L` `F` `B` `U` `D`
