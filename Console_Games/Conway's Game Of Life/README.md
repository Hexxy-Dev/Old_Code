This project is just a non interactive simulation.

To run, just type make in this folder and it will open each preset one by one. To go to the next preset just simply close the terminal with the currently running one

The implementation used here is quite *"unique"* and **very** inefficient

---

Some features are missing compared to the original version tho:
- resize terminal
- square font 
- fit whole simulation on screen
